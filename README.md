OnMyWay
=======

On My Way - HTML5 app that sends a text message (or email) to my spouse... when I leave work. Send location and ETA.
Uses localstorage and Google, and just sends dumb SMS/email messages via server. Nothing fancy, just scratching an itch.
Shout out to Thom Loring for the original genesis.
